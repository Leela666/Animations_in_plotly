# Animations_in_plotly

Animations are designed to work well when each row of input is present across all animation frames, and when categorical values mapped to symbol, color and facet are constant across frames. Animations may be misleading or inconsistent if these constraints are not met.

There are different types of animated charts in plotly.

some of the examples are done here.

colab link for the charts are:
